p1: 'One of the projects I have worked on in my time at StrongMind has been working with our digital marketing specialist to develop high performing landing pages. Landing page design follows the scientific method where you make a hypothesis, and you create a test to validate your assumptions.'
p2: ' For this project, I designed the pages and built them in HTML, CSS, and JS. The idea was to build something lightweight that could be iterated quickly. After A/B testing we learned that more sales focused content increased conversions more than pretty design. '
