p1: 'Holy Cross Tucson needed a logo and print materials for a finance campaign, as well as branding, print materials, and a wall graphic for their childrens ministry.  I developed a logo and color pallet for their capital campaign and used those assets in the branding of the childrens ministry.'
p2: 'Pete, the lead pastor at Holy Cross, communicated that he wanted to represent their ministry in a fresh new way, with clean design. The logo for the campaign is a literal translation of their tag line "A church to call home" with an illustration of the building and the shadow of a home.'
