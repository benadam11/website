p1: 'Windmill Winery was one of the last clients that I worked with as a part of Blinktank. My partner Caleb lead the charge with the branding and icons, while I tackled the web experience.  His feedback and suggestions were a critical part of this project. The web assets were the final deliverable of a larger branding project.'
p2: 'Windmill had old site that was clunky and difficult to navigate, so organizing the information into a logical flow was the primary challenge of this project.Because they are in the wedding industry, we used large imagery liberally throughout the site to tell the story of their brand and differentiate them from their competitors.'
