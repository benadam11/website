### Two thumbs up for DocPad

About a year ago a buddy turned me on to this thing called [Docpad](http://www.docpad.org/). Essentially Docpad is a tool for building any type of web application.  It uses node.js to do the dirty work of compliling sass, coffeescript, and eco templates into static pages. Simply put ... it's amazing. 

My goal for this site is that it would be a place for me to grow in my skills and experiment.  I will probably change things around quite frequently and write some pretty ugly code, but all in the name of progress. For now... welcome and hopefully you will find my site enjoyable. 

This are a few projects that I still need to tackle
1. Move page layouts into templates
2. Add a few subtle interactions
3. Split up my scss files into more relevant partials

I will post the developments so stay tuned!
