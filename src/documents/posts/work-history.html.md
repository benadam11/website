###Some people grow up knowing what they what they want to do.
I was not one of those people.  Growing up I was exposed to a variety of different activities.  Here are a few of things I was involved in:

1. Piano Lessons
2. Band
3. Guitar
4. Drums
5. Swimming
6. Basketball 
7. Baseball
8. Soccer

I guess it boiled down to two main interests: sports and music.  As I gearing up to go to college, the time came for me to purchase my first computer. After going to the Apple store the choice was obvious.  I couldn't explain why I needed to have a Macbook, but I needed one.  I suppose in hindsight, I wanted to be cool, and having an Apple computer made me cool.  How is this relevant to my work experience you ask? Well, I decided that day that I wanted to work on Mac computers no matter what I did.  

Because of my interest in music, I used my Mac to make terrible recordings (which were later called out by a friend ending my music career), but my love for Macs persisted.  In College, I needed a website to raise awareness and funds for a year long missions trip that I was going on, so I learned how to set up a wordpress blog.  I had to learn how to set up a database, and install wordpress (it took me forever).  And as frustrating as it was struggling to set up a wordpress theme, there was this egnigmatic joy that I felt when I got it to work.  

###Becoming a "Professional"

A family friend saw my blog and immediately contacted me about building websites for his new company. He offered to pay me 100 dollars per website (big spender!) and that sounded great to me.  This all sounds so juevenile now, but it was a big deal to me then.  I was entirely unqualified to charge for my services, but they liked what I did and no one told me that I couldn't, so I kept going.  

After doing about 10 sites for them, I moved to South Africa for a year pressing pause on my web development interests. After returning, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life.  I had graduated college with a major in sustainability (which was all but worthless for getting a job) and I had no prospects for jobs.  So what do you do when you have no prospects and no real skills? Start a business. 

###Starting Blinktank

I started Blinktank, a small creative agency, with a friend.  We started everything from scratch.  There was no one to show us the way and we struggled to find our way.  But we learned a tremendous amount in 2 years. I wore many hats, one of them included front end developer. Because most of our projects had limited budgets and we were mainly focused on design, most of the websites we delivered for clients were pre-existing wordpress themes that we customized for our clients. 

Our work at Blinktank ebbed and flowed, and because we did video, branding and web I became more of a creative utility player. The combination of wearing numerous hats, and the instability of being self-employed lead me to pursue other opportunities.  I now work at StrongMind as a content strategist / copywriter, but I have felt more and more strongly that I need to focus on one spefic disciple.  Nothing has kept my interest like front end development.  That egnigmatic feeling I felt years ago, I still feel today.  I am committing my energy and focus towards learning front-end development and that's why I am now looking for a full time position as a front-end developer. 

###Self-Assessment 

If you were to ask me if I am confident in my skills I would say yes ... and no. Because of my years of working in a silo (both for my freelance projects and projects with blinktank) I have become very resourceful.  I can almost always figure out how to solve the problem at hand.  However, the great disadvantage of working in a silo is that I have never had meaningful feedback that would help ensure that I am doing things the best or most efficient way.  I hunger for this community and it is a key factor in deciding where I want to work. 

I would say that my HTML & CSS skills are at at least an intermediate level, and my Javascript skills are at a beginner level.  The intagibles of understanding user experience, business goals, and communication I would give myself high marks.  I think with these intagibles guiding my growth, I can be an asset to whatever team I work on.  I also can tell a mean joke.
