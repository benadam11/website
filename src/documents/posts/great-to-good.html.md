##The Result of Long Hours and Mounting Frustration

I heard the door slam as my fiancee walked into the house. She had been growing increasingly frustrated with my long hours, and I am still on the phone with a business call. I knew that the ensuing conversation was not going to go well for me.A little backstory: My fiancee and I have been looking for an apartment in addition to her going through nursing school and me working two jobs ( oh, and we’re planning a wedding).

The reality is, I don’t have time to be creative (or pursue much professional development) outside of work. In order to produce great work, and continue a fast rate of professional growth, I must sacrifice time with my (future) wife, family and friends. Greatness, it would seem, is found in the late nights, long hours, and full dedication to craft and career. Of all of the great designers and creatives that I follow, the vast majority of them are single (and from what I gather, introverts). I am neither.
